allowing users to log in and register
today you're going to learn it completely
email login using json web token oauth google login and much more

with that you can like other people's posts and notice this you can also delete your own post
-> you also can create new posts yourself
implement only one like per person considering that we now have the accounts
it's easy to simply keep an account who like things
before you were able to like indefinitely but now you can only leave one like per post

added quite a few complex features such as login and registration using json web token so that's also something
we're going to learn today
oauth using google
